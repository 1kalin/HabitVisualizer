# Pull Request: Fix DayOfWeek Type Issues

## Branch Name
HV-002

## Issue
The application was showing TypeScript errors related to the DayOfWeek type in server/storage.ts:

```
Error on line 195:
Type '{ [x: number]: number; length: number; toString: () => string; toLocaleString: { (): string; (locales: string | string[], options?: (NumberFormatOptions & DateTimeFormatOptions) | undefined): string; }; ... 37 more ...; readonly [Symbol.unscopables]: { ...; }; }' is not assignable to type 'DayOfWeek[]'.
  The types returned by 'pop()' are incompatible between these types.
    Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'DayOfWeek | undefined'.
```

Similar errors appeared in multiple places where frequencyDays property was used without proper type casting.

## Changes Made
Modified `server/storage.ts` to add explicit type casting for DayOfWeek type:

1. Added explicit type casting for all `frequencyDays` property usages to `DayOfWeek[]`
2. Added explicit type casting for `dayOfWeek` variables to `DayOfWeek` when used in includes() checks
3. Applied these fixes across the entire storage.ts file

## Before the Fix
```typescript
const habit: Habit = {
  id,
  name: habitData.name,
  description: habitData.description ?? null,
  color: habitData.color ?? null,
  frequencyDays: habitData.frequencyDays, // No explicit type cast
  reminderTime: habitData.reminderTime ?? null,
  createdAt: now,
  userId: habitData.userId ?? null,
};
```

```typescript
const isHabitDayOfWeek = (habit.frequencyDays as number[]).includes(dayOfWeek);
```

## After the Fix
```typescript
const habit: Habit = {
  id,
  name: habitData.name,
  description: habitData.description ?? null,
  color: habitData.color ?? null,
  frequencyDays: habitData.frequencyDays as DayOfWeek[], // Explicitly cast to correct type
  reminderTime: habitData.reminderTime ?? null,
  createdAt: now,
  userId: habitData.userId ?? null,
};
```

```typescript
const isHabitDayOfWeek = (habit.frequencyDays as DayOfWeek[]).includes(dayOfWeek as DayOfWeek);
```
